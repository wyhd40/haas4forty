 Does politics seem like a game to you? I'm not sure. This is new to me, and I'm not sure I'm a "playa". For example, I tend to align myself with ideas instead of people and I don't play favorites or make decisions based on donations or back scratching. Clearly this is not a good way to make friends, but if you're in politics for personal reasons like selfish power or hanging out with your buddies, maybe that's not such a good thing. These people are making decisions that effect your life, do you want them making those decisions based on who their friends are or because they like seeing their name on signs in people's yards? No, I didn't think so.
