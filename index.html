			  <h2>A little about me</h2>
          <p>I was born in the Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1971. A bunch of childhood happened in Vermont then I graduated from high school in 1989.</p>
          <p>In the years between 1989 and 1997 I lived in many places around the U.S. During the first half of the 90s, I attended two small colleges. One on a farm in the Western North Carolina mountains and the other in the woods in Vermont. My official graduation from Marlboro College in Vermont was in 1995. My last semesters at school were completed mostly off campus as I grew weary of moving between East and West so regularly. I also spent some time living and working in Texas and Wisconsin. I spent several months traveling the country with my dog in an Jeep J-20. I first moved to Wyoming in December of 1996. Wyoming had officially been a state for just over 106 years and was finally willing to let me in, I guess. I'd most recently been working on ranches in South East and South Central Montana, first seasonally, then full time. </p>
          <p>

				<p class="text-center">Wyoming House District 40 Map.<br /><i><small>source: http://soswy.state.wy.us/Elections/HD31-40.aspx</small></i></p></div>
			</div>Before moving to Wyoming I made a meager living working manual labor and agricultural jobs. Keep in mind that I'm a white male so my struggles in the lower middle-class white America, however painful they felt at the time, weren't ever really that bad. I was young, bullet-proof and doing my best to fix any mistakes I made. Days after finding a place to rent in Sheridan, I found a job working with at-risk kids in the wrap-around program run by the Northern Wyoming Mental Health Center. I started that in January and worked there for the next two years as a Skill Trainer and a Case Manager. A colleague there introduced me to my wife-to-be.</p>
          <p>I ran my own tutoring business in Sheridan for about two years before our first child arrived. We were living in Banner. My wife was working for JCSD#1. In early 2003 we moved to Buffalo, WY and I took a job with the Buffalo Theater, LLC.</p>
          <p>My family (wife, son, daughter, 3 dogs, 1 cat, 1 horse) and I still live in Buffalo, WY. I stopped working at the Theater in December 2009. I'd been helping people find computer and web-based solutions since the 1980s as a hobby. In 2010 I started to gently develop a small client base. I'm grateful for the work I can do between being a father and husband. I recently spent a couple years on the JCSD#1 school board, before resigning to apply for a job in the district. I didn't get hired, but I still stay involved, as a parent, in many of the issues before that board. This past year I've been helping out a few days a week at the St. Francis Animal Shelter in Buffalo.</p>
          <p>I grew up in a lot of different places around the U.S. at a lot of different times. I'm still growing up and now feel like I'm growing older. I have a lot to offer. I like to ask and face hard questions. I like to find solutions to problems, especially when others are earnestly trying as well. I believe with enough hard work, education, empathy, love and hospitality everything will be alright. Each day is a new chapter.</p>
